			        While it’s  easy to look up a record of individual campaign finance transactions, not everyone is able to look at a spreadsheet of financial history and understand the motives and influences driving the machinery of local elections.  It’s even hard for campaign professionals and journalists to do that. The Behind the Curtain app uses technology visualize campaign finance data in a more meaningful way -- and at the best of times –- let the data tell its own story.

							Ultimately, we believe that voters want to be informed, and using tools rooted in real data tha can filter through the noise of campaign-driven media and third party reporting is fundamental to empowering honest democracy in the post-internet era.</a>

							Did you think so? We’re happy about that.

							We realized after our first round of user-testing that most people aren’t used to interacting with data as a way to learn about something they don’t understand.  For many of us, politics can be one of those subjects that is rooted in a lot of myth, misinformation, and intense emotion reactions.  On top of that, the real impact of local politics can seem even more opaque. Making something for everyone that can use data (scary) as a way to make sense of local elections (what?) is a challenge that called for constant editing, and we killed a lot of our darlings.

							All the things that we learned and built that didn’t make this initial launch, truly deserves its own blog post.  Look forward to that on <a href="http://www.hackoregon.org">hackoregon.org</a>.

							This project is possible because of enormous dedication from volunteer developers, designers, and context experts. To be totally honest, this project was completed with a budget of $2,500 from a single anonymous donor and we spent the money almost entirely on Domino’s pizza ($5.99 medium two topping carry-out specials), occasional beer from Costco, and a few web tools for working with the data.

			        We calculate our "money raised" category based on how much money a campaign has raised during the current election cycle - so starting November 2012.  It is not uncommon for candidates to have money remaining from previous campaigns that they can carry forward for future campaigns. Currently this amount is not accounted for in our totals.  Therefore, campaigns may appear to have spent more than they have raised.

			        The Oregon Secretary of State does not have the infrastructure set up to provide regular data dumps, therefore we must scrape the data directly from their website in order to keep our data as current as possible.  We do this data scrape daily in an attempt to provide the most current information as possible.  However, due to the structure of their site, our scrapers do occasionally miss some of the data.  Each record generated on our site provides the number of transactions that our data is using to calculate our totals.  For the most current transaction data please visit the <a href="https://secure.sos.state.or.us/orestar/GotoSearchByElection.do">Oregon Secretary of State’s website</a> and search for the campaign or candidate you are looking for.

			        In this map, states are shaded by how much money was sent from a particular state to an Oregon Political Action Committee (PAC) or Candidate. This map represents the current election cycle (November 11, 2010 to present).
			        <br><br>
							To find the amount of money contributed to or spent by Oregon PACS, we used the following transaction fields from the ORESTAR database:
							<br><br>
							Contributions:  Cash contribution, in-kind contribution, items sold at fair market value, loan forgiven (non-exempt), interest/investment income
							<br><br>
							Expenditures:  Cash expenditure, expenditure made by agent, personal expenditure for reimbursement, miscellaneous other receipt, lost or returned check, miscellaneous other disbursement, return or refund of contribution, uncollectable pledge of cash, uncollectable pledge of in-kind
							<br><br>
							Find out more about each of these fields <a href="http://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Documents/campaign-finance.pdf">here</a>.
							<br><br>
							We merged the contributions and expenditures from DC with Maryland to make the money flowing through DC appear more readily on the map.
							<br><br>
							Although not visualized on the statewide map, there have been many contributions from countries outside of the US, such as the UK and Australia.
